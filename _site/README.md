# Welcome to my portfolio & blog!

If you are anything like me, you managed to drag your feet in actually building
your portfolio. I had a lot of questions: Do I build it from scratch, or use a template? What do I showcase? What do I say?!?!?!

After many months of procrastinating, I found a great template from HTML5 UP. I've made several changes to the style and organization of the website.

Below are the details of what was used to make this site.
